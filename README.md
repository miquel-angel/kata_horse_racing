We need to create a system to calculate the general ranking for a horse racing championship that consist on several races.
There are 2 types of races, with different ranking system:  
  Trial Race: 
    1st gets 10 points 
    2nd gets 7 points 
    3rd 3 points 
    4th 1 point  
  Classic Race: 
    1st gets 25 points 
    2nd gets 18 points 
    3rd gets 10 points 
    4th gets 
    2 points
    
Furthermore, the horses can get penalties due to bad behaviour during the race.
Penalties remove N points from the horse ranking.  

An example would be the following:  
  Trial Race 
  --------------- 
    1st "Horsy" 
    2nd "John the little horse" 
    3rd "Always places third"  
    
  Classic Race
  ------------------ 
    1st "John the little horse" 
    2nd "Horsy" 
    3rd "Always places third"   
With a penalti for "John the little horse" of 3 points, the final championship ranking would be  

  Global Classification
  ------------------
    John the little horse 29 points
    Horsy 28 points
    Always places third 13 points
